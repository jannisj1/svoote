# Svoote - Simple, modern live polling

[Svoote](https://svoote.com) is an easy to use and lightweight live polling tool.
It is designed to be privacy-friendly with a free-tier that is available without logging in or creating an account.
The created polls can be downloaded as json and later uploaded again, giving you control over where you want to store your data.

To support the operation and development of this website, there will be a Pro-Tier that you can subscribe to in the future.
However you can always self-host Svoote, with all Pro-Features included.

Made and hosted in the EU ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

## Self-hosting

You need to have Rust installed to run Svoote. Then just go `cargo run --release` and you should have a running web-server on `localhost:8080`.
